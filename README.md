# Poker


This repo contains source code for a program which takes in a text file of standard playing cards ([2-10, J, Q, K, A] of [S, D, C, H]) in rows of 10 cards.
It returns a typed output of how many rounds were won by the left or right hand of 5 cards.

It is a solution to a technical test for developers, so while you're welcome to look at it for ideas, it's not worth the trouble to copy it outright.
The company you're applying to will know.

This repo contains an executable .jar file. Please place your text file of cards in the same directory for easier access.
It will request the name of the file to be read in.

Example: from any command line (windows, linux, OSX):

Path/Of/Jar> java -jar Poker.jar
